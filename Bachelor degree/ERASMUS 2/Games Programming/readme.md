## Gameplay of my game
I am providing a demonstrative gameplay at [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6yNk9aptU).

## Assignment outline
In this this assignment you develop an arcade style game. The game needs to be implemented in C++ facilitating the GFC game engine. You will have to go through the complete development cycle (Design – Implementation – Testing and the Presentation of your game).

## Development of your game
Define the game objectives, such as tasks the player must perform and the level of
player interaction. It is important to concentrate on the game mechanics and
implementation details first. Translate the game mechanics into C++ code. The game
must be based on the GFC game engine.
Once the core mechanics of your game are implemented, more time can be spent on
improving the appearance. Choose or edit suitable bitmap graphics. You may also
incorporate graphics from your “favourite” games, however, due to copyright issues,
the game cannot be distributed. Sound and music sequences should be converted into the wave
(.wav extension) format. Sound can be loaded from 16 bit 48kHz .wav files.
