# University Projects
This repository contains the projects I developed during my academic years at ["Universit√† di Roma, La Sapienza"](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home) and at the [Kingston University](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/) (during my two ERASMUS periods).

## Bachelor degree
- **ERASMUS 1:**
  - **Database:** Design and development of a [database application](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/Database).
  - **Networking:** Two courseworks on [Physical Network design](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/Networking/Coursework1%20-%20physical%20network%20design) and [IP Addressing scheme design](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/Networking/Coursework2%20-%20IP%20addreessing%20scheme%20design).
  - **User Centered Design:** Two courseworks on an in-depth [Design Comparation](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/User%20Centered%20Design/Coursework%20A%20-%20Design%20comparation) between the paper and the online version of a newspaper and a [Website design](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/User%20Centered%20Design/Coursework%20B%20-%20Website%20design).
- **ERASMUS 2:**
  - **Computing Systems:** Two courseworks on [Networking](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Computing%20Systems/Networking%20Coursework) and [Operating Systems](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Computing%20Systems/Operating%20Systems%20Coursework).
  - **Dependable Systems:** 3 [Technical Essays](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Dependable%20Systems) about Systems Development, Agile Software Development and Extreme Programming.
  - **Games Programming:** a [2D Game Development](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Games%20Programming).
  - **Professional Environments:** 3 [Technical Reports](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Professional%20Environments) about Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing and Encryption.
- **Sistemi di Calcolo:** [C codes](./Bachelor%20degree/Sistemi%20di%20Calcolo/Code) produced during the course.
- **Thesis:** My bachelor degree's [final thesis](./Bachelor%20degree/Tesi/My_thesis.pdf) "Navigazione autonoma di robot in ambiente indoor". Here I describe intelligent agents and the used softwares, then, the stages I faced during the project: mapping, auto-localization of the robot inside the map and path planning to reach a goal. The project was developed on Ubuntu 16.04 operative system with C++ and using the [Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org/) (ROS) framework. 

## Master degree

- **Computer Graphics:** Three homeworks about modeling and rendering three-dimensional scenes. In particular, a [Ray tracer](./Master%20degree/Computer%20Graphics/HW1), a [Path tracer](./Master%20degree/Computer%20Graphics/HW2) and a [Volumetric Path tracer](/Master%20degree/Computer%20Graphics/HW3) have been developed using YoctoGL.
- **Machine Learning:** Two homeworks on text and images classification and two [Reinforcement Learning projects](./Master%20degree/Machine%20Learning). In the first project a game (SpaceInvaders) is implemented as a Gym space. In the second one ["Ant-v2"](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Ant-v2/), a four-legged creature, aims to learn how to walk in a OpenAI Gym MuJoCo environment with the exploitation of Neural Networks and the [Soft Actor-Critic](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/sac.html) (SAC) algorithm, one of the state-of-the-art methods in the RL field.
- **Neural Networks:** A project on [Radiograph images classification](./Master%20degree/Neural%20Networks) between the COVID-19, Pneumonia and Normal classes. The study is performed by creating and training a model based on one of the major state-of-the-art Neural Networks, [ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385): this network is here modified and is able to gain even better results thanks to the application of transfer learning and, in particular, fine-tuning and progressive resizing.
- **Interactive Graphics:** Two homeworks centered on realizing basics of Computer Graphics like rendering a scene, shadowing, variable lighting and animations with WebGL. The [final project](./Master%20degree/Interactive%20Graphics/project) is realized with the [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) framework and is a simplified re-implementation of the [Mario Kart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart) racing game from Nintendo.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Two homeworks on [Word-in-Context Disambiguation](./Master%20degree/Natural%20Language%20Processing/HW1) (WiCD) and on [Word Sense Disambiguation](./Master%20degree/Natural%20Language%20Processing/HW3) (WSD) using PyTorch. The first homework uses [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network), like LSTMs and GRUs, to determine whether a word shares the same semantic meaning in a pair of sentences. The second one is fully based on [BERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html) Transformers architecture, which is trained to output the most likely semantic meaning of an ambiguous word occurring in the context of a sentence.
- **Vision and Perception:** Two homeworks on [Image Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing) and Multiview Geometry ([Projective Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry)) and a final project on Computer Vision based on [SinGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01164) architecture, where the network learns how to generate new random samples from a simple natural image such that each sample contains a different configuration of objects while preserving the visual content of the training image. Then, the model focuses on the extreme case of faces, learns how to create realistic instances of human faces and is used for a face inpainting application.
