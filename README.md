# University Projects
This repository contains the projects I developed during my academic years at "Universit√† di Roma, La Sapienza".

## Bachelor degree
- **ERASMUS 1:**
  - **Database design and development**
  - **Networking:** Physical Network design and IP Addreessing scheme design.
  - **User Centered Design:** in-depth Design Comparation between the paper and the online version of a newspaper and a Website design.
- **ERASMUS 2:**
  - **Computing Systems:** Networking and Operating Systems courseworks.
  - **Dependable Systems:** Technical Essays about Systems Development, Agile Software Development and Extreme Programming.
  - **Games Programming:** 2D Game Development.
  - **Professional Environments:** Technical Reports about Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing and Encryption.
- **Sistemi di Calcolo:** C codes.
- **Thesis:** Navigazione autonoma di robot in ambiente indoor.

## Master degree

- **Computer Graphics:** Ray tracer, Path tracer and Volumetric Path tracer using YoctoGL.
- **Machine Learning:** Two homeworks on text and images classification. Two Reinforcement Learning projects; in the first one a game (SpaceInvaders) is created as a gym space. In the second one a Neural Network aims to learn walking in a OpenAI Gym MuJoCo environment with the exploitation of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, one of the state-of-the-art methods in the RL field.
- **Neural Networks:** Radiograph images classification (COVID-19, Pneumonia or Normal). The study is performed by creating and training a model based on one of the major state-of-the-art Neural Networks, ResNet50: this network is here modified and is able to gain even better results thanks to the application of transfer learning and, in particular, fine-tuning and progressive resizing.
- **Interactive Graphics:** Two homeworks centered on realizing basics of Computer Graphics like rendering a scene, shadowing, variable lighting and animations with WebGL. The final project is realized with the BabylonJS framework and is a simplified re-implementation of the Mario Kart racing game from Nintendo.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Two homeworks on Word-in-Context Disambiguation (WiCD) and on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using PyTorch. The first homework uses Recurrent Neural Networks, like LSTMs and GRUs, that aims to understand whether a word shares the same semantic meaning in a pair of sentences. The second project is fully based on BERT Transformers trained to output the most likely semantic meaning of an ambiguous word occurring in a context.
