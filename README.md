# University Projects
This repository contains the projects I developed during my academic years at ["Universit√† di Roma, La Sapienza"](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home) and at the [Kingston University](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/) (during my two ERASMUS periods).

## Bachelor degree
- **ERASMUS 1:**
  - **Database:** Design and development of a [database application](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/Database).
  - **Networking:** Two courseworks on [Physical Network design](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/Networking/Coursework1%20-%20physical%20network%20design) and [IP Addreessing scheme design](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/Networking/Coursework2%20-%20IP%20addreessing%20scheme%20design).
  - **User Centered Design:** Two courseworks on an in-depth [Design Comparation](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/User%20Centered%20Design/Coursework%20A%20-%20Design%20comparation) between the paper and the online version of a newspaper and a [Website design](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/User%20Centered%20Design/Coursework%20B%20-%20Website%20design).
- **ERASMUS 2:**
  - **Computing Systems:** Two courseworks on [Networking](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Computing%20Systems/Networking%20Coursework) and [Operating Systems](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Computing%20Systems/Operating%20Systems%20Coursework).
  - **Dependable Systems:** [3 Technical Essays](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Dependable%20Systems) about Systems Development, Agile Software Development and Extreme Programming.
  - **Games Programming:** a [2D Game Development](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Games%20Programming).
  - **Professional Environments:** [3 Technical Reports](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Professional%20Environments) about Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing and Encryption.
- **Sistemi di Calcolo:** [C codes](./Bachelor%20degree/Sistemi%20di%20Calcolo/Code).
- **Thesis:** My bachelor degree's final thesis ["Navigazione autonoma di robot in ambiente indoor"](./Bachelor%20degree/Tesi/My_thesis.pdf).

## Master degree

- **Computer Graphics:** [Ray tracer](./Master%20degree/Computer%20Graphics/HW1), [Path tracer](./Master%20degree/Computer%20Graphics/HW2) and [Volumetric Path tracer](/Master%20degree/Computer%20Graphics/HW3) using YoctoGL.
- **Machine Learning:** Two homeworks on text and images classification. Two [Reinforcement Learning projects](./Master%20degree/Machine%20Learning); in the first one a game (SpaceInvaders) is created as a gym space. In the second one a Neural Network aims to learn walking in a OpenAI Gym MuJoCo environment with the exploitation of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, one of the state-of-the-art methods in the RL field.
- **Neural Networks:** [Radiograph images classification](./Master%20degree/Neural%20Networks) (COVID-19, Pneumonia or Normal). The study is performed by creating and training a model based on one of the major state-of-the-art Neural Networks, ResNet50: this network is here modified and is able to gain even better results thanks to the application of transfer learning and, in particular, fine-tuning and progressive resizing.
- **Interactive Graphics:** Two homeworks centered on realizing basics of Computer Graphics like rendering a scene, shadowing, variable lighting and animations with WebGL. The [final project](./Master%20degree/Interactive%20Graphics/project) is realized with the BabylonJS framework and is a simplified re-implementation of the Mario Kart racing game from Nintendo.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Two homeworks on [Word-in-Context Disambiguation](./Master%20degree/Natural%20Language%20Processing/HW1) (WiCD) and on [Word Sense Disambiguation](./Master%20degree/Natural%20Language%20Processing/HW2) (WSD) using PyTorch. The first homework uses Recurrent Neural Networks, like LSTMs and GRUs, that aims to understand whether a word shares the same semantic meaning in a pair of sentences. The second project is fully based on BERT Transformers trained to output the most likely semantic meaning of an ambiguous word occurring in a context.
