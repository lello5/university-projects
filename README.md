# University Projects
This repository contains the projects I developed during my academic years at ["Universit√† di Roma, La Sapienza"](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home) and at the [Kingston University](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/) (during my two [Erasmus+](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/) periods).

## Bachelor Degree
- **Erasmus 2018:**
  - **Database:** Design and development of a [Database application](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/Database).
  
  - **Networking:** Two courseworks about designing the [Physical Network](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/Networking/Coursework1%20-%20physical%20network%20design) and the [IP Addressing scheme](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/Networking/Coursework2%20-%20IP%20addreessing%20scheme%20design) for an enterprise.
  
  - **User Centered Design:** Two courseworks on an in-depth [Design Comparation](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/User%20Centered%20Design/Coursework%20A%20-%20Design%20comparation) between the paper and the online version of a newspaper and on designing and developing of a [Responsive Website](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%201/User%20Centered%20Design/Coursework%20B%20-%20Website%20design).

- **Erasmus 2019:**
  - **Computing Systems:** Two courseworks on [Networking](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Computing%20Systems/Networking%20Coursework) and [Operating Systems](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Computing%20Systems/Operating%20Systems%20Coursework). The first one is about identifying, reviewing, and understanding (at every layer) the IP protocols involved in the seemingly simple scenario of requesting a web page from a laptop. The second one is about the Windows Operating System, in particular: its Architecture, its Message and Event Handling and its Resource Management.

  - **Games Programming:** Design, implementation and testing of ["Alien Attack"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT6yNk9aptU), a [2D arcade style game](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Games%20Programming). The game has been developed in C++ facilitating the GFC game engine.
  
  - **Dependable Systems:** [Three Technical Essays](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Dependable%20Systems) about Systems Development, Agile Software Development and Extreme Programming.
  
  - **Professional Environments:** [Three Technical Reports](./Bachelor%20degree/ERASMUS%202/Professional%20Environments) about Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing and Encryption.

- **Sistemi di Calcolo:** [C codes](./Bachelor%20degree/Sistemi%20di%20Calcolo/Code) produced during the course.

- **Thesis:** My Bachelor Degree's [final Thesis](./Bachelor%20degree/Tesi/My_thesis.pdf) "Navigazione autonoma di robot in ambiente indoor". Here I describe intelligent agents and the used softwares, then, the stages I faced during the project: mapping, auto-localization of the robot inside the map and path planning to reach a goal. The project was developed on Ubuntu 16.04 operative system in C++ and using the [Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org/) (ROS) framework. 

## Master degree

- **Computer Graphics:** [Three Homeworks](./Master%20degree/Computer%20Graphics/) about modeling and rendering three-dimensional scenes. In particular, a [Ray Tracer](./Master%20degree/Computer%20Graphics/HW1), a [Path Tracer](./Master%20degree/Computer%20Graphics/HW2) and a [Volumetric Path Tracer](/Master%20degree/Computer%20Graphics/HW3) have been developed in C++ using [YoctoGL](https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl).

- **Machine Learning:** [Two Homeworks](./Master%20degree/Machine%20Learning) on Text and Images Classification and [two Reinforcement Learning (RL) projects](./Master%20degree/Machine%20Learning). In the [first homework](./Master%20degree/Machine%20Learning/ML_Homework_1), a Malware Detection model which classify Assembly code lines was developed using classical methods as [Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) and [Support Vector Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine). In the [second homework](./Master%20degree/Machine%20Learning/ML_Homework_2) images are classified using [Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network). In the [first RL project](./Master%20degree/Machine%20Learning/RL_Homework) the very popular [Space Invaders](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) game is implemented as a Gym space. In the [second project](./Master%20degree/Machine%20Learning/RL_project), a four-legged creature named ["Ant-v2"](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Ant-v2/) aims to learn how to walk in a OpenAI Gym MuJoCo environment with the exploitation of Neural Networks and the [Soft Actor-Critic](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/sac.html) (SAC) algorithm, one of the state-of-the-art methods in the RL field.

- **Neural Networks:** A project on [Radiograph Images Classification](./Master%20degree/Neural%20Networks) between the COVID-19, Pneumonia and Normal classes. The study is performed by creating and training a model based on one of the major state-of-the-art Neural Networks, [ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385): this network is here modified and is able to gain even better results thanks to the application of transfer learning and, in particular, fine-tuning and progressive resizing.

- **Interactive Graphics:** [Two Homeworks](./Master%20degree/Interactive%20Graphics) centered on realizing basics of Computer Graphics like rendering a scene, shadowing, variable lighting and animations with WebGL. The [final project](./Master%20degree/Interactive%20Graphics/project) is realized with the [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) framework and is a simplified re-implementation of the [Mario Kart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart) racing game from Nintendo: you can [play it](https://sapienzainteractivegraphicscourse.github.io/final-project-ll-team/) or [watch a gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5YD2v_OD2o).

- **Natural Language Processing:** [Two Homeworks](./Master%20degree/Natural%20Language%20Processing) on Word-in-Context Disambiguation (WiC) and on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using PyTorch. The [first homework](./Master%20degree/Natural%20Language%20Processing/HW1) uses [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network), like LSTMs and GRUs, to determine whether a word shares the same semantic meaning in a pair of sentences. The [second homework](./Master%20degree/Natural%20Language%20Processing/HW3) is fully based on [BERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html) Transformers architecture, which is trained to output the most likely semantic meaning of an ambiguous word occurring in the context of a sentence.

- **Vision and Perception:** [Two homeworks](./Master%20degree/Vision%20and%20Perception) on [Image Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing) and Multiview Geometry ([Projective Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry)) and a [final project](./Master%20degree/Vision%20and%20Perception/Final%20Project) on Computer Vision based on [SinGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01164) architecture, where the network learns how to generate new random samples from a simple natural image such that each sample contains a different configuration of objects while preserving the visual content of the training image. Then, the model focuses on the extreme case of faces, learns how to create realistic instances of human faces and is used for a face inpainting application.
